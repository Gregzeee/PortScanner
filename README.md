# PortScanner
 Simple port scanner made in python

 Time spent making this project: 3 hrs 34 mins (This does not include googling. This only includes the time that I actually spent inside the files coding)
 Current scanning speed: 
 - 1 thread: 300 ports per minute
 - 5 threads: 1500 ports per minute
 - 10 threads: 3000 ports per minute
 # Todo

 - Add customizability with colorama maybe
 - Add more detail to the message which says Port <port number> is open.
 - Add async functions
 - Add socket reusage
 - Add a possibility to scan ip ranges all for same port ranges.
